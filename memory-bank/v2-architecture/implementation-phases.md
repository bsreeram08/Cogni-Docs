# Implementation Phases & Migration Strategy

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

### Event Bus System

- Message broker for workflow coordination
- Event routing and subscription management
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Progress tracking and observability

- Extract code elements from source files
- Analyze technical specifications and guides
- Structure-aware chunking with semantic boundaries

### Enhanced Metadata Schema

- Developer-focused chunk metadata
- Code entity extraction and linking
- Cross-document reference tracking
- Workflow context preservation

### Basic Workflow Engine

- State management across processing steps
- Event coordination and orchestration
- Workflow definition and execution
- Result aggregation and storage

## Phase 2: Intelligence Layer

- Integration point detection
- Dependency graph construction
- Breaking change identification

### Developer Business Rules Engine

- API completeness validation
- Code quality analysis
- Security pattern checking

- Circular dependency detection
- Critical path analysis
- Version conflict resolution

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

### Breaking Change Detection

- Version compatibility analysis
- API evolution tracking
- Impact assessment tools
- Automated migration suggestions

### Migration Path Planning

- Automated upgrade recommendations
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Incremental migration strategies
- Timeline and effort estimation

### Security Analysis Engine

- Code security pattern validation
- Vulnerability detection in examples
- Best practice compliance checking
- Security recommendation generation

### Performance Optimization

- Batching and parallel processing
- Intelligent caching strategies
- Resource usage optimization
- Scalability improvements

## Migration Strategy from v1

### Backward Compatibility Approach

- v1 pipeline remains functional during transition
- Gradual migration of document types to v2 workflows
- Feature flags to enable v2 processing selectively
- Dual-mode operation during transition period

### Configuration Evolution

```typescript
// v1 Configuration
{
  agent: {
    enabled: true,
    name: "heuristic",
    options: {}
  }
}

// v2 Configuration
{
  workflow: {
    enabled: true,
    engine: "developer_v2",
    eventDriven: true,
    rules: [
      "api_completeness",
      "security_check",
      "integration_analysis"
    ],
    documentTypes: {
      "api_reference": { workflow: "api_discovery" },
      "codebase_analysis": { workflow: "codebase_onboarding" },
      "technical_spec": { workflow: "integration_planning" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Migration Process

1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Deploy v2 event bus and core components
   - Configure dual-mode processing
   - Set up monitoring and observability

2. **Gradual Document Type Migration**
   - Start with api_reference documents
   - Migrate sdk_documentation next
   - Follow with codebase_analysis
   - Complete with tutorial_guide and technical_spec

3. **Feature Flag Management**
   - Per-document-type v2 enablement
   - A/B testing between v1 and v2 results
   - Performance and quality comparison
   - Rollback capabilities if needed

4. **Data Migration**
   - Re-process existing documents with v2 engine
   - Preserve v1 results for comparison
   - Update metadata schemas incrementally
   - Maintain search index compatibility

## Timeline Considerations
